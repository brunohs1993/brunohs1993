Hey, there!

My name is Bruno, I am a mechanical engineer from Brazil, currently living in France. My thing is computational modelling in general, but focused on transport phenomena, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, as well as the optimisation of the systems that comprise them.

Besides that, I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimisation applications and almost any system modelling really, for the pure fun of it.

My go-to tool is Python for its flexibility, but I also know some Matlab and I'm starting to take some baby steps through C++ territory when the time allows me to, so I can speed things up when needed.

Currently I am on my final year of Ph.D. at Universit√© de Lorraine, under supervision of Prof. Laurent Chaput and Prof. David Lacroix. I am working on a Python code to simulate phonon transport and optimise semiconductor nanodevices. When it is done, it should be flexible enough to run in almost any geometry and completely automated so that we can leave it doing its job while we turn coffee into other stuff without worrying. Here is a sneak peek:

If you are interested to have a coffee and talk about projects, please send me a message.
