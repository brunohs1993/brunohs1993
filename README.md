# Hey, there!

My name is Bruno, I am a mechanical engineer with a PhD in Energy and Mechanics. My thing is computational modelling in general, although I have mostly focused on heat transfer, almost always in Python (MATLAB and some FORTRAN before that).

Besides that, I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimisation applications and almost any system modelling really, for the pure fun of it.

I'm currently working as Scientific Software Engineer at TwiinIT, developping numerical models of complex systems. You can know more at [https://twiinit.com/](https://twiinit.com/).

My most recent work was my PhD thesis, the development of Nano-&#954; , a Python code to simulate phonon transport and optimise semiconductor nanodevices. The objective is for Nano-&#954; to be flexible enough to run in almost any geometry and completely automated so that we can leave it doing its job while we turn coffee into other stuff without worrying. For more information, visit its [repository](https://github.com/brunohs1993/Nanokappa).

If you are interested to have a coffee and talk about ideas, please send me a message on my socials. Cheers!
