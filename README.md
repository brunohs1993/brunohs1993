Hey, there!

My name is Bruno, I am a mechanical engineer from Brazil. I deal mostly with computational modelling of transport phenomena, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, and the optimisation of the systems that comprise them.

Besides that, I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimisation applications and almost any system modelling really, for the pure fun of it.

Currently I study heat conduction in nano and micro scales at the University of Lorraine as part of my Ph.D.
