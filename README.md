# Hey, there!

My name is Bruno, I am a mechanical engineer and a PhD in Energy and Mechanics. My thing is computational modelling in general, but mostly focused on transport phenomena, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, as well as the optimisation of the systems that involve them.

Besides that, I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimisation applications and almost any system modelling really, for the pure fun of it.

My go-to tool is Python for its flexibility, but I also know some Matlab and I'm starting to take some baby steps through C++ territory when the time allows me to, so I can speed things up when needed.

My most recent work is de development of Nano-&#954; , a Python code to simulate phonon transport and optimise semiconductor nanodevices. The objective is for Nano-&#954; to be flexible enough to run in almost any geometry and completely automated so that we can leave it doing its job while we turn coffee into other stuff without worrying. For more information, visit its [repository](https://github.com/brunohs1993/Nanokappa).

If you are interested to have a coffee and talk about ideas, please send me a message on my socials. Cheers!
