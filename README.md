Hey, there!

My name is Bruno, I am a mechanical engineer from Brazil. My thing is computational modelling in general, but focused on transport phenomena, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, as well as the optimisation of the systems that comprise them.

Besides that, I am interested in artificial intelligence and optimisation applications and almost any system modelling really, for the pure fun of it.

Currently I am on my final year of Ph.D. at Université de Lorraine, in Nancy, France, under supervision of Prof. Chaput and Prof. Lacroix, working on a Python package to simulate phonon transport and optimise nanodevices.

If you are interested please send a message.
